# Word Wrap

This is a pretty simple problem - like a word processor or editor, wrap text so that it doesn't exceed the max width.
Prefer breaks at a space, or hyphen if no space is available, otherwise break at the given width.

Width is a command line argument. Read the input from stdin, then output on stdout.

Extras:
* Input/Output as filename arguments to the command
* Allow in-place wrap of a file
